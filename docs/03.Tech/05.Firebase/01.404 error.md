# Firebase Hosting 404 error
## Senario
I created a React.js website, I can fresh non-homepage without any problem, then I locate it on hosting, it shows 404 error when I refresh the non-homepage.
## Solution
1. Find file "firebase.json" in root directory.
2. Modify the =="hosting"==
```json
 "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
          "source": "**",
          "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
```
